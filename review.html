        <h2>Preface</h2>
        <p>Established in 1958, the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, is the college every aspiring engineer dreams to be in. Although there aren’t any ‘official rankings’ in India, it is widely regarded as the place to be if you want to pursue a career in engineering. The college has reached new highs of success in research and is now trying to enter the big league of engineering education and research.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Campus and Infrastructure</h2>
        <p>The huge 500 acre campus divided into clusters of buildings. The academic area chiefly comprises the main building, various departmental annexes and auditoria. Due to its proximity to the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, the campus has significant green cover and is mostly untouched by the pollution of the rest of the city. The proximity of the campus to the national park has also led to occasional sightings of panthers, Leopards and Gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) crocodiles along the banks of Lake Powai.</p>
        <p>
         The institute has two swimming pools; football, hockey and cricket grounds; and tennis, basketball, squash and volleyball courts. It also has a Students' Activity Center (SAC) for various cultural and other extracurricular activities.
         <br>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Hostels</h2>
        <p>There are a total of 16 hostels, of which two hostels (Hostels 10 and 11) and a part of the newly constructed hostel (Hostel 15) are for female students. Older hostels have 400 students while new ones will accommodate 800 students. Separate apartment facilities are provided for PG students and their families. Each hostel is equipped with its own mess, sports facilities, music room etc. The wing culture is unique to each hostel and is a matter of pride during intra hostel competitions. Each of them has a unique name, the most interesting being Hostel 7 - "The Lady of the Lake" which is a lake facing hostel. There is high speed LAN access in every room without any restrictions on download limits, while the academic area is WiFi enabled.

        <h1>Review</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Foreword</h3>
        <p>
            I am Aadhar from Civil engineering department (B.Tech) IIT Bombay. I am a fresher and I joined IITB on 22/7/15 and I consider this as my best decision till now. </p>
            <br>
        <h3>Procedure and Preparation</h3>
        <p>
            The procedure for admission is quite complex starting from Jee Mains and ending with Jee Advanced I took 3 years to crack these exams including 2 years at Indore and 1 year at Kota and I studied rigorously during my last year for around 8 hours a day to fulfill my dream of becoming an IITian but I think that 2 years of sincere preparation is sufficient for anyone to clear these exams, things will be more easy for reserved people.</p>
            <br>
        <h3>Fests and Events</h3>
        <p>When it comes to events,we have 3-4 events daily and some mega annual events like Mood Indigo, Techfest etc which indeed require no introduction.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Sports Facilities</h3>
        <p>
            For sports we have both indoor and outdoor sports ranging from table tennis, football, basketball etc. Other than this we have events like marathon,cycling,rappelling etc and an awesome swimming pool.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Faculty</h3>
            <p>The faculties are very cooperative and most of them are quite beyond what I expected. Attendance varies with professor, but most require 80%. DX grade given in case required attendance as stated is not achieved and the student has to repeat tthe course.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Interaction With Seniors</h3>
            <p>We interact a lot with our seniors and are on friendly terms with them. We call them by their first name only,and use ‘aap’ while addressing them.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Placements and Internships</h3>
            <p>At the best institute in India, you expect some brilliant internships and placements, and IIT Bombay does not disappoint. Some of the best companies from all fields – including investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the big names of management consultancy like McKinsey, BCG and Bain pick up a number of IITians at some hair-raising salaries. It’s one of the very few colleges visited by IT leaders like Samsung,Microsoft and Google, and the salaries can go as high as 80 lac per annum. The average package stands at about 9 lac. In short if any company visits India for recruitment their first choice will be IIT Bombay.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Hostel and Mess</h3>
        <p>
            Hostel and mess are perhaps the most disappointing thing here,the mess food isn't very delicious but we have other substitutes as well, including night canteen which can certainly help, the rooms are sufficient but from the next year we will have really tiny rooms. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Ragging</h3>
        <p>
        Ragging isn't a problem here, at most the seniors take our introduction.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Level Of Burden</h3>
        <p>
        	But academics is really painful and the level of burden increases exponentially during exams.</p>
        	<br>
        	<h3>Verdict</h3>
        	<p>In all I wanna conclude that there are a lot of reasons why IITB is the best college in India.
