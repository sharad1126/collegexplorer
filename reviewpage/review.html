        <h2>Review</h2>
        <br><br>
        <p>
           I am Aadhar from Civil engineering department (B.Tech) IIT Bombay. I am a fresher and I joined IITB on 22/7/15 and I consider this as my best decision till now. </p>
        <p>
            The procedure for admission is quite complex starting from Jee Mains and ending with Jee Advanced I took 3 years to crack these exams including 2 years at Indore and 1 year at Kota and I studied rigorously during my last year for around 8 hours a day to fulfill my dream of becoming an IITian but I think that 2 years of sincere preparation is sufficient for anyone to clear these exams, things will be more easy for reserved people. When it comes to events,we have 3-4 events daily and some mega annual events like Mood Indigo,Techfest,etc which indeed require no introduction.</p>
        <p>
            For sports we have both indoor and outdoor sports ranging from table tennis, football,basketball,etc Other than this we have events like marathon,cycling,rappelling,etc and an awesome swimming pool The faculties are very cooperative and most of them are quite beyond what I expected We interact a lot with our seniors and are on friendly terms with them. We call them by their first name only,and use ‘aap’ while addressing them.</p>
        <p>
            Hostel and mess are perhaps the most disappointing thing here,the mess food isn't very delicious but we have other substitutes as well, including night canteen which can certainly help, the rooms are sufficient but from the next year we will have really tiny rooms. </p>
        <p>
            Ragging isn't a problem here, at most the seniors take our introduction.
        	But academics is really painful and the level of burden increases exponentially during exams. In all I wanna conclude that there are a lot of reasons why IITB is the best college in India.
