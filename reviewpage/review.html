        <h2>Campus</h2>
        <br>
        <p>IIT Delhi is located in Hauz Khas, South Delhi. The campus of 325 acres (132 ha) is surrounded by the beautiful Hauz Khas area and monuments such as the Qutub Minar and Lotus Temple. The IIT-D campus is divided into four zones:
            <ul>
                <li>Student Residential Zone</li>
                <br>
                <li>Faculty and Staff Residential Zone</li>
                <br>
                <li>Student Recreational Area</li>
                <br>
                <li>Academic Zone</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
        </p>
        <h2>Hostels</h2>
        <br>
        <p>There are 14 hostels (11 for boys and 3 for girls). There are also apartments for married students. All the hostels are named after mountain ranges in India.Girnar House had the highest number of residents in 2011 with more than 700 students[citation needed]. Each Hostel has its distinct culture of sports and cultural activities. Hostels compete in inter hostel events to bring home various trophies which include RCA and GC, which are the highest awards for cultural and sports accomplishments over a year by a particular hostel. RCA was claimed by Jwalamukhi in year 2010, Kumaon in 2011 while it was shared between Kumaon and Shivalik in 2012. Kumaon also won the 2011 and 2012 GC trophies, as well as the BHC trophies for both 2011 and 2012.

            <h2>Postgraduate programs</h2>
            <br>
            <p>IIT Delhi offers many postgraduate programs (M.Tech(by coursework), M.S.(by Research), M.Sc., M. Des., MBA under various departments and centres. The school of MBA in IIT Delhi is Department of Management Studies. The admission to M.Tech and M.Des programs are carried out mainly based on Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE).</p>
            <br>
     
            <h2>Faculty</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Students are full of praise for most of the professors. Every professor teaching here has a doctorate, but sometimes students find that their teaching isn’t quite as brilliant as expected. But then again, that’s probably because the bar at IIT Delhi has been set so high.</p>

			<p>Attendance criteria is decided by the professor and generally kept at 75%. Usually no fail grade is alloted for attendance shortage, however, one grade penalty is common.</p>
            <br>
       
            <h2>Mess/ Canteen/ Hangouts</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Students spend four years of their lives cursing the mess food. And you can’t really blame them, considering the food-paradise that lies just outside the campus - Safdarjung Developement Area (SDA market). There are outlets like Barista, Costa Coffee, Subway and various confectioners at SDA. PVR Priya is the nearest theatre at a 10 minutes walk.</p>
            <br>
       
            <h2>Placements and Internships</h2>
            <br>
            <p>It’s one of the best technological institutes in the country, of course it’s bound to have fantastic placements! Some of the top companies in the world visit IITD, and offer higher salaries than most other engineers across India can only dream of. The average salary is about Rs.7 lac, and the highest salary offered could even be three times that, which is just frankly bonkers if you ask us.</p>

        <h1>Review</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            I am Aadhar from Civil engineering department (B.Tech) IIT Bombay. I am a fresher and I joined IITB on 22/7/15 and I consider this as my best decision till now. </p>
        <p>
            The procedure for admission is quite complex starting from Jee Mains and ending with Jee Advanced I took 3 years to crack these exams including 2 years at Indore and 1 year at Kota and I studied rigorously during my last year for around 8 hours a day to fulfill my dream of becoming an IITian but I think that 2 years of sincere preparation is sufficient for anyone to clear these exams, things will be more easy for reserved people. When it comes to events,we have 3-4 events daily and some mega annual events like Mood Indigo,Techfest,etc which indeed require no introduction.</p>
        <p>
            For sports we have both indoor and outdoor sports ranging from table tennis, football,basketball,etc Other than this we have events like marathon,cycling,rappelling,etc and an awesome swimming pool The faculties are very cooperative and most of them are quite beyond what I expected We interact a lot with our seniors and are on friendly terms with them. We call them by their first name only,and use ‘aap’ while addressing them.</p>
        <p>
            Hostel and mess are perhaps the most disappointing thing here,the mess food isn't very delicious but we have other substitutes as well, including night canteen which can certainly help, the rooms are sufficient but from the next year we will have really tiny rooms. </p>
        <p>
            Ragging isn't a problem here, at most the seniors take our introduction. But academics is really painful and the level of burden increases exponentially during exams. In all I wanna conclude that there are a lot of reasons why IITB is the best college in India.
